  # Returns the sum of given parameters by assigning the parameters to a variable
  # in the R shell, summing the remotely on the R shell, and receiving the

    # Assign the input array to a variable in the remote R host:
    conn.assign "x", input_array

    # Print on the R Host something, so we can see on the Rserve logs
    # that communication is indeed happening:

    # Return the sum of the array done on the remote R Host:
